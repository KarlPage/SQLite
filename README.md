# SQLite
A single C# file to import and use SQLite functionality.

## Overview

 I wanted to embed my SQLite usage within my main program. The idea, is simply to have a single executable and minimal DLL's for my project.
There appear to be numerous entries for SQLite for both .NET Core and Framework.
Using Nuget, in my experience, tends to create a lot of unnecessary, dependencies.
SQLite is coded in C,C++ so will always require a corresponding DLL for C# to Interop with.
